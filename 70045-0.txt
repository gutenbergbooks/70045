DISSERTATION continued.


The unabating ardour that still prevails in the science of botany, and
rather increases than diminishes, renders it almost impossible (from
the extreme minutiæ annexed to this elegant tribe) for the pencil of
the artist to keep pace with the numerous importations from the Cape
(at present the sole emporium of the genus Erica); the limits of the
genus it is impossible at present to prescribe, but by the termination
of the next volume we have no doubt of being able to ascertain, in some
measure, its extent. The author’s intention is therefore to figure
(first) all the most elegant and desirable of the genus, including many
very beautiful varieties, of recent introduction, that far surpass
those from which they derive their name; reserving, as a dernier
ressort, the most uninteresting and least attractive, to subjoin at
the termination of the genus, as necessary links in the chain of this
extensive family. The great difficulty attending the cultivation of
many of the species, so generally complained of, can only be surmounted
by great care and attention to keep them from the partial damps and
fogs so prevalent in this island. Among the most tender and difficult
to preserve, and which require the most care, are the E. obbata, E.
retorta, E. ampullacea, E. Aitonia, E. Jasminiflora, E. vestita alba,
and E. Massonia; the last of which is perhaps the most tender, owing
most likely to the closeness of the leaves, joined with the soft hairs
that surround them, which is a great encourager of secreted damps:
this, assisted by the great succulence that pervades the upper part of
the plant, and its rather abrupt commencement from the wood, renders
it so difficult to be preserved. They should by no means be intermixed
with other plants, but kept in a house entirely appropriated to them,
and so arranged that the air may have as free an egress and regress as
possible to them all; as undoubtedly the mixing of them with plants
whose foliage is so much larger, although it may produce a pleasing
contrast, must exclude the free approach of the atmosphere, to which
they are so much exposed in their native clime, and to which the
nearest approximation must certainly be most congenial.
